# spine-map

This skill answers one question per commentary, once: **which of this commentary's own
sa-bcad nodes (or, where the sa-bcad is coarser than the spine, which of its claims) hold
the content for which canonical spine slot of the root text?** The answer is a small
routing table at `$CLAIMS/raw/spine-map/<registered-id>.md`. It records addresses
only — node numbers, claim IDs, slot names — and never what a claim says.

It exists because `claims-consolidate` (Phase 1) used to re-derive this mapping inside every topic
run: Stage 1 read all sixteen raw claims files (~3.8 MB, 2,975 claims) once per topic, so a
full ~25-topic run meant ~400 full-corpus reads of the same unchanged files. The mapping is
per-commentary, not per-topic — resolving one commentary's numbering against the spine
answers it for all 21 Tārās at once — so it belongs here, computed once, and reused by
`assemble_packet.py` for every topic thereafter.

Correct output is a table in which **every claim in the commentary's raw claims file has
exactly one disposition** (routed to a slot by node, routed to a slot by claim ID, flagged
ambiguous, or logged under an unmapped node), the counts are computed rather than
hand-tallied, and `verify_spine_map.py` exits clean. A map that leaves a claim
undispositioned silently deletes that claim from every future topic page — which is exactly
the "silent claim loss" failure the consolidation pipeline exists to prevent.

**This skill makes no interpretive claims and therefore adds no link to the citation chain.**
It is an index over `$CLAIMS/raw/tree-guided/`, read-only on everything it touches.

## Inputs

- **The commentary's finished TOC tree** — `$SECTIONS_RAW/toc-tree/<registered-id>.md`,
  `status: complete`. This is the structure being mapped *from*. If it is missing or not
  QC-clean, stop: run `toc-generate` first.
- **The commentary's raw claims file** — `$CLAIMS/raw/tree-guided/<registered-id>.md`.
  Read its **claim heading lines** (`##### c-… <title>`) for routing; you do not need to read
  claim bodies except to resolve a genuine ambiguity.
- **The root text** — `$SOURCE_TEXTS/<root>.md` — ground truth for what each spine slot *is*
  (its verse, its block ID, its opening words). Consult it whenever a node title does not
  itself name the slot.
- **The canonical slot list** — `4-SYSTEM/Guidelines/vault-annex.md` §2a. This is the vault's
  registry of spine slots and their root anchors. Never invent a slot ID that is not
  registered there; if the commentary needs one that does not exist, stop and ask the human
  contributor to register it first.
- If any of the above is missing for a commentary that should be mapped, stop and ask rather
  than guessing a mapping.

## Output

One file at `$CLAIMS/raw/spine-map/<registered-id>.md`.

It sits under `Claims/raw/` because it is per-commentary and derived from one commentary in
isolation, like everything else there — but it is an **index layer, not an extraction**: it
adds no claims and is regenerable at any time without touching the extractions it points at.

---

## Output file format

Template: `4-SYSTEM/Templates/spine-map.md`. Follow it exactly — `assemble_packet.py` and
`verify_spine_map.py` both parse these tables, so heading names and column order are a
contract, not a style preference.

# Spine map — <registered-id>

> Routing index only. …

**Structure of this commentary.** <Two to four sentences: how this commentary's tree is
shaped, where the spine content sits in it, and what evidence establishes the correspondence
(node titles that name the homages by ordinal or epithet, root-verse quotations inside the
claims, etc.). This paragraph is what a later reader needs to trust the table.>

## Slot map

| Slot | Root anchor | Node(s) | Node title(s) (verbatim) | Claims |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tara-01` | `^1-1` | `1.1.1` | དང་པོ་ཕྱག་འཚལ་ | 9 |

## Claim-level routing

| Slot | Claim ID(s) | Why routed by claim rather than by node |
|---|---|---|
| `tara-01` | `c-2-1-2-1-1`–`c-2-1-2-1-6` | Node 2.1.2.1 runs all 21 homages undivided; boundaries are the "Verse N quoted" claims. |

## Ambiguous claims

| Claim ID | Candidate slots | Why uncertain |
|---|---|---|
| (none) | | |

## Silent slots

| Slot | Why silent (where derivable) |
|---|---|

## Unmapped nodes

| Node | Title (verbatim) | Claims | Why not a spine slot |
|---|---|---|---|
```

## Rules

1. **Routing only — never interpretation.** This file records addresses. Do not restate,
   summarise, paraphrase, or evaluate a claim's content anywhere in it. The "why" columns
   explain the *routing decision*, not the doctrine. (A spine map is not a rail in the
   citation-chain sense and must never become one.)
2. **Node numbering is never assumed uniform.** This is `claims-consolidate` (Phase 1) Rule 1, and it
   is the whole reason this skill needs a model rather than a script. One commentary nests a
   homage at `1.1.N`, another at top level `N`, another titles nodes by epithet instead of
   ordinal, another runs all twenty-one homages inside a single undivided node. Verify every
   row against *this* commentary's own tree and the root text. A numbering rule that worked
   for the last commentary is evidence of nothing about this one.
3. **Every claim gets exactly one disposition.** Every claim ID in the raw file must be
   covered by exactly one of: a Slot map node's subtree, a Claim-level routing row, an
   Ambiguous row, or an Unmapped nodes row. Neither zero (silent loss) nor two (silent
   duplication into two packets) is acceptable. `verify_spine_map.py` enforces this.
4. **Never map a node and its own descendant to different slots.** Node routing is by
   subtree, so mapping node `1.1` sweeps in every `1.1.*`. When a parent node has its own
   direct claims that belong somewhere else, route *those claims* through Claim-level
   routing and leave the parent node unmapped.
5. **Node titles are copied verbatim.** Character-for-character from the TOC tree — no
   normalization, no truncation, no translation in that column.
6. **Counts are computed, never hand-tallied.** Fill the Claims column and every frontmatter
   count from `verify_spine_map.py --counts <id>`, then let the verifier recompute them.
   (`claims-consolidate` (Phase 1) Rule 15, same discipline, same reason.)
7. **Silence is a finding.** A registered slot this commentary genuinely does not treat goes
   in Silent slots with a reason where one is derivable — never simply left out. A slot that
   is neither mapped nor marked silent is a gap, and `assemble_packet.py` will fail on it.
8. **Ambiguity is carried through, never silently resolved.** A claim you cannot confidently
   route goes in Ambiguous claims with its candidate slots and the reason — never
   force-fitted to the nearest slot, never dropped. The assembler passes it into every
   candidate slot's packet with a visible flag so the consolidator decides in the open.
9. **Slot IDs come from the annex registry.** Lowercase-hyphenated, exactly as registered.
   Never coin one locally.
10. **Read-only on everything but the output.** Never modify `$SOURCES/`,
    `$CLAIMS/raw/tree-guided/`, or `$SECTIONS_RAW/toc-tree/` while mapping.
11. **`status: draft`, always.** An LLM never marks its own output complete — a domain
    specialist does, per `$RAILS/About Rails.md`.

## Procedure

1. **Get the claim inventory.** Run:

   ```
   python3 4-SYSTEM/Skills/spine-map/verify_spine_map.py --counts <registered-id>
   ```

   This prints every node that holds claims, how many, and the node's title from the TOC
   tree. It is the checklist for step 5: every node listed here must end up somewhere.

2. **Read the TOC tree in full.** `$SECTIONS_RAW/toc-tree/<registered-id>.md`. Identify
   which branch carries the root text's spine content and which branches are the commentary's
   own additions (front matter, origin narrative, ritual appendices, story collections,
   colophon).

3. **Read the canonical slot list.** `4-SYSTEM/Guidelines/vault-annex.md` §2a — the registered
   slots and their root anchors.

4. **Establish the correspondence, with evidence.** For each slot, find the node whose title
   or content attests it — an ordinal ("བཅུ་གསུམ་པ་ཕྱག་འཚལ་"), an epithet naming that Tārā, or a
   quotation of the root verse. Where the tree is coarser than the spine (one node holding
   several slots), scan that node's **claim heading lines** in the raw claims file: root-verse
   quotation claims ("Verse N quoted: …") are the reliable boundary markers. Consult the root
   text whenever the correspondence is not self-evident from the title.

5. **Assign a disposition to every node from step 1.** Spine nodes → Slot map rows. Coarse
   nodes covering several slots → Claim-level routing rows, using en-dash ranges
   (`c-2-1-2-1-2`–`c-2-1-2-1-6`) rather than listing every ID. A parent node's own direct
   claims → Claim-level routing (Rule 4). Everything genuinely outside the spine (front
   matter, `0`/`z` pseudo-nodes, the commentary's own appendices) → Unmapped nodes with a
   reason. Anything you cannot decide → Ambiguous claims.

6. **List the silent slots.** Every registered slot with no row in the Slot map and no
   Claim-level routing row goes in Silent slots, with a reason where derivable from the
   source.

7. **Write the file** at `$CLAIMS/raw/spine-map/<registered-id>.md`, per the template.
   Fill counts from step 1.

8. **Verify (gate, mandatory).**

   ```
   python3 4-SYSTEM/Skills/spine-map/verify_spine_map.py $CLAIMS/raw/spine-map/<registered-id>.md
   ```

   Fix every ERROR and re-run until zero remain; review each WARN and either fix it or note
   why it stands. The checks are: node existence against the tree, claim existence against
   the raw file, disposition completeness (no uncovered, no doubly-covered claims),
   ancestor/descendant node overlap, recomputed counts, and slot hygiene.

**Orchestration.** Commentaries are independent — this fans out cleanly, one isolated agent
per commentary, exactly like `commentary-claims` (Strategy 1)'s per-node isolation and for the same
reason: an agent that has just mapped another commentary's tree is primed to see the same
numbering here, which is the specific error Rule 2 exists to prevent.

      consciously accepted
- [ ] `status: draft` in frontmatter
- [ ] No file under `$SOURCES/`, `Claims/raw/tree-guided/`, or `Sections/Raw/toc-tree/` was
