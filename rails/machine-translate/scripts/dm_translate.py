"""dm_translate.py — block-by-block zero-shot translation via DharmaMitra cat-translate.

Reads a block-ID'd source file from 1-SOURCES/, sends a SMALL BATCH of adjacent
blocks per API call (DharmaMitra's own guidance is 3-5 sentences per call),
threads the previously translated blocks back in as rolling context, and writes
both an append-only JSONL ledger (audit trail, resume point) and a rendered
block-ID-aligned markdown translation.

Batched blocks are separated by [[n]] marker lines that the model is instructed
to echo; the response is split back on those markers. If the markers do not come
back exactly 1..N, the batch is automatically retried one block per call, so
block-ID alignment can never be lost to a bad split.

Never writes to 1-SOURCES/. Output goes to a machine-baseline track folder under
3-TRANSFORMATIONS/Translations/ and never replaces an existing human or
rails-generated translation.

Endpoint: POST https://dharmamitra.org/api-search/cat-translate/v1/translate
No API key. Stdlib only (urllib) — no pip install.

Usage:
  dm_translate.py --source 1-SOURCES/Text/<file>.md --lang english
  dm_translate.py --source ... --lang german --limit 3          # smoke test
  dm_translate.py --source ... --lang english --only 1-1,1-2
  dm_translate.py --source ... --lang english --batch 1         # one block per call
  dm_translate.py --source ... --lang english --render-only     # re-render from ledger

# {tag}-dharmamitra-zeroshot — about this track

A **machine baseline**, not a rails-governed translation track.

Every file here is raw output of DharmaMitra's public `cat-translate` endpoint,
produced in small batches of adjacent block IDs by
`4-SYSTEM/Skills/dharmamitra-translate/scripts/dm_translate.py`, then split back
apart on segment markers so each block keeps its own record. Nothing in it
passed through `2-RAILS/`: no verse-context package, no consolidated bilingual
glossary, no per-track `termbase.md`, no human review. It therefore does **not**
satisfy the Translation-track contract in
[`../About Transformations.md`](../About%20Transformations.md) §3, and it is not
eligible to be marked `status: complete` or to be cited by any other
transformation.

## What it is for

- A comparison baseline against which a rails-governed translation can be judged.
- A drafting aid and a source of candidate renderings for
  `2-RAILS/Bilingual-Glossaries/` (via `glossary-extract-raw`).
- A fast first look at a text in a language no track covers yet.

## What governs it

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `style.md` | The `style_instruction` string, sent **verbatim** to the API on every call. Edit it, then re-run with `--force` to regenerate. |
| `context-header.md` | A work-NEUTRAL, track-wide preamble prepended to every call's `context`. The per-text `Work: …` line is derived from each source's own metadata and appended after it. |
| `work/{tag}.jsonl` | Append-only ledger: one record per API call — source, translation, the exact context sent, timings. The audit trail and the resume point. |
| `{slug}-{tag}.md` | The rendered translation, block-ID aligned to the source. |

## Provenance

- Endpoint: `{endpoint}` (public, unauthenticated)
- Source: [`{src}`]({src})
- Granularity: up to 3 adjacent source block IDs per API call, never crossing a
  heading; each block still gets its own ledger record and its own block ID.
- Rolling context: the preceding translated blocks of this same document are
  threaded into each call so terminology and register stay coherent.

Regenerate or extend with:

```bash
python3 4-SYSTEM/Skills/dharmamitra-translate/scripts/dm_translate.py \\
  --source "{src}" --lang {lang}
```

    `prov` lets a sibling generator (the gemini-translate skill) reuse this
    exact renderer — same body shape, same frontmatter skeleton — while naming
    itself honestly. It is a dict with `label` (the title suffix), `generator`,
    `endpoint`, `fields` (an ordered dict of generator-specific frontmatter
    keys that sit where `focus`/`context_blocks`/`batching` sit here) and
    `warning` (the callout text).

    FORK(21-taras-rails) — three things differ from the Liturgy renderer:

    * Frontmatter keys the renderer cannot know (backend ids, researched
      titles, import provenance — PRESERVE_FM_KEYS) are carried over from the
      file being overwritten, and `extra_fm` (a dict) overrides them. There is
      no separate stamping pass in this vault.
    * The frontmatter is what the vault linter expects of a `file_type:
      translation` note: `title` is the work's title in the target language,
      `root_text` points at the Tibetan, `language`/`lang_tag`/`category_id`/
      `license`/`source`/`edition_type` are present.
    * Layout `transclusion` (the default) puts an Obsidian transclusion of
      the Tibetan block above each translated block instead of a blockquote
      copy — that is what the vault parser reads the alignment from, and it
      never goes stale when the root is edited. A section heading is rendered
      from its own ledger record (kind: heading, see --headings) when one
      exists, otherwise the Tibetan heading is reproduced verbatim. The H1 is
      always the work's title from the frontmatter.
