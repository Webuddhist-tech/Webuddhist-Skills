apply.py — commentary-verse-id skill

Adds Obsidian-style block IDs (^{chapter}-{n}) to commentary segments in a
segmented Tibetan commentary markdown file, based on the chapter number
found in the nearest preceding root-text transclusion.

Pattern recognized:
    ![[bo-<root-title>#^<chapter>-<verse>]]
    > <root verse line(s)>
    <commentary paragraph(s)...>

Rules:
- Transclusion lines (![[...]]) are never modified and never receive an id.
- The "chapter" number is the first number in the transclusion's block ref
  (e.g. ^1-1 -> chapter 1, ^2-1 -> chapter 2).
- Before the first transclusion in the file (no root text transcluded yet),
  segments are tagged with chapter "0" (^0-1, ^0-2, ...) instead of being
  left untagged. As soon as the first transclusion is encountered, the
  chapter switches to its real number and the counter resets to 1.
- A running per-chapter counter starts at 1 the first time a chapter number
  is seen (or changes from the previous transclusion's chapter number, or
  from the initial "0" pre-transclusion zone). It does NOT reset on every
  transclusion — multiple transclusions within the same chapter (e.g.
  #^1-2, #^1-3) continue the same running counter.
- Every non-blank, non-transclusion, non-heading line gets
  " ^{chapter}-{counter}" appended to its end, and the counter increments
  by 1 for the next such line. This includes root-quote lines (> ...) and
  commentary paragraphs alike, and applies from the very first content line
  of the file (chapter "0" if no transclusion has appeared yet).
- Blank lines, YAML frontmatter, and markdown headings (#, ##, ...) are
  left untouched and do not consume a counter value.
- Lines that already end with a block id (matching / \^\d+-\d+$/) are left
  untouched (idempotent re-runs won't double-tag).
- Original line endings (CRLF or LF) and total line count are preserved.

Usage:
    python apply.py audit <path-to-file.md>
    python apply.py apply <path-to-file.md> [output.md]

`audit` reports how many segments would be tagged and the chapter/counter
ranges it detects, without writing anything.
`apply` writes the tagged output. If output.md is omitted, the input file
is overwritten in place.
