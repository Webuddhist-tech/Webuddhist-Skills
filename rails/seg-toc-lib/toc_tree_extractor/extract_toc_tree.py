extract_toc_tree.py — ས་བཅད (sa bcad) structural-outline candidate extraction
using Google Gemini Flash.

This is the Gemini runner of the `commentary-toc-extract` skill
(4-SYSTEM/Skills/commentary-toc-extract). It does the whole pipeline end to end:

    1. Chunk the input file into overlapping line windows.
    2. Send each chunk to Gemini with the sa-bcad extraction prompt.
    3. Save one result file per chunk under
       0-INBOX/temp/TOC-<commentary-id>/candidates/ (resumable). A second pass copies the
       raw enumeration blocks to 0-INBOX/temp/TOC-<commentary-id>/enumerations/.
    4. Combine all chunk results into 0-INBOX/temp/TOC-<id>/toc-candidates-<id>.md.
    5. Send the merged candidates back to Gemini and build a full nested,
       decimal-numbered TOC tree saved to 0-INBOX/temp/TOC-<id>/toc-tree-<id>.md,
       then QC it (0-INBOX/temp/TOC-<id>/toc-tree-qc-<id>.md).  (skip with --no-tree)

The extraction step prioritises RECALL: it is better to extract too many
candidates than to miss one.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert in classical Tibetan Buddhist texts specialising in ས་བཅད (sa bcad) — \
the structural outlining system used in Tibetan commentarial literature.

Your task is to extract the ས་བཅད SECTION TITLES from the input text chunk — the
genuine structural divisions of the text, NOT every number, list, or ordinal you see.

Balance recall and precision. Extract a candidate only when it truly marks a structural
section: a division being announced, a header opening a section, or a closing count that
defines a structural division. Capture every real section, but when you are not confident
that something is a structural section rather than incidental text, LEAVE IT OUT. A clean
list of real sections is worth more than an exhaustive list full of false positives.

THREE SECTION TYPES — extract all three independently:

Type A — Announcement
A passage where the author declares a division: a topic is split into N named parts.
  e.g. དང་པོ་ལ་གཉིས་ཏེ། མཚན་དོན་དང་། འགྱུར་ཕྱག་གོ།

Type B — Node header
A short label opening a section, signalling "now treating part N."
  e.g. གཉིས་པ་འགྱུར་ཕྱག་ནི།

Type C — Closing count
A number word appearing after a list, summarising how many items were just given.
  e.g. ཞེས་རྣམ་པ་གསུམ་མོ། / གནས་བརྒྱད་དོ། / ཚུལ་བཞི་པོ་དེ་དག

RECOGNITION — meaning first, markers second.
Do not pattern-match on surface markers alone. For each passage ask: is this text
dividing a topic into named parts, labelling a sub-section, or counting items just
listed? If yes — regardless of exact wording — extract it.

Common signals — any one is enough:
- Topic announced then split into named sub-parts
- Ordinal labels: དང་པོ། / གཉིས་པ། / གསུམ་པ། (even scattered across paragraphs)
- Division words: སྟེ། / ལ། / དབྱེ་ན། following a topic heading
- Number word near a list of named items
- Verse listing items that prose then unpacks
- ལ་སོགས་པ། closing a partial list with a nearby number
- རྣམ་པ་ / གནས་ / ཚུལ་ / ཞེས་བྱ་བ་ within 30 words of a number

CAPTURE THESE (genuine sections):
- དང་པོ་ / གཉིས་པ་ / གསུམ་པ་ labels that open a structural section
- Announcements that divide a topic into named structural sub-parts
- Closing counts that define a structural division
- Nested sections — extract both inner and outer separately
- Sections in the overlap zone — extract once only

DO NOT EXTRACT (common false positives — these are NOT sections):
- Numbers that are part of the doctrinal content itself (enumerations of qualities,
  attributes, dimensions, or quantities being explained — not the text's own outline)
- Numerals inside quotations, citations, folio/page references, dates, or mantra counts
- Ordinal-looking words used in ordinary prose rather than as section labels
- Counts summarising a list mentioned only in passing, with no structural role
- A section already extracted earlier in this same chunk (do not repeat it)
When unsure, omit it. Precision matters: do not pad the output with doubtful candidates.

OUTPUT FORMAT — for each section output EXACTLY this block, nothing more:

CONTEXT: [20 Tibetan words before + 20 Tibetan words after the section]
SECTION_TITLE: [the section ordinal marker TOGETHER WITH the section's topic name, but
WITHOUT any trailing division clause or grammatical particle. Strip the "divided into N"
phrase (e.g. ལ་གཉིས་ཏེ། , ལ་གསུམ་ལས། , ལ་བཞི། ) and trailing markers such as ནི། and the
closing shad །. Keep the ordinal; keep the topic words; drop only the trailing
particle / division phrase. Examples:
    དང་པོ་ལ་གཉིས་ཏེ།      ->  དང་པོ་
    གཉིས་པ་འགྱུར་ཕྱག་ནི།   ->  གཉིས་པ་འགྱུར་ཕྱག་
    གསུམ་པ་མཚན་དོན་ནི།     ->  གསུམ་པ་མཚན་དོན་]
LINE: [the source line number (from the leading "N:" prefix in the chunk) where the
announcement or section opening BEGINS — the first line of the passage that announces
or opens this section. This may be earlier than the line containing the SECTION_TITLE
ordinal itself (e.g. when the division clause begins on a preceding line). Use the
line numbers visible in the CONTEXT field to identify the start.]
ITEMS:
1. [first named item, in Tibetan]
2. [second named item, in Tibetan]

No commentary. No analysis. No linking. List each named item on its own line under
ITEMS:, numbered 1., 2., 3., ... If items cannot be determined, write "ITEMS:" on its
own line followed by a single line "[implicit]". Separate section blocks with a single
blank line. If the chunk contains NO sections at all, output exactly: NO CANDIDATES

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TREE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert in classical Tibetan Buddhist ས་བཅད (sa bcad) structural outlines.

You are given TWO inputs from a single commentary, in document order.

INPUT 1 — CANDIDATES: extracted section headers. Each block looks like:

    CONTEXT: <surrounding Tibetan>
    SECTION_TITLE: <ordinal + topic name, trailing particle/division phrase stripped,
                    e.g. གཉིས་པ་འགྱུར་ཕྱག་>
    LINE: <source line number where the section node header opens>
    ITEMS:
    1. [[N]]<first named sub-part>
    2. [[N]]<second named sub-part>
    (ITEMS may be a single line "[implicit]" when sub-parts are not stated)

CRITICAL RULE FOR ITEMS:
Every item listed under ITEMS: is a DIRECT CHILD of its parent SECTION_TITLE — always
one level deeper, never promoted to a higher level. The [[N]] prefix on each item is
its source line number; use it as the [[line]] suffix for that child node in the tree.
Do NOT add Tibetan ordinals (དང་པོ་, གཉིས་པ་, གསུམ་པ་, ...) to item text unless the
item text itself already starts with one. Do not invent ordinals.

INPUT 2 — ENUMERATIONS: the author's division announcements, copied VERBATIM from the
source (no interpretation). They are grouped into blocks like:

    Enumeration Block 1:
    <verbatim Tibetan: "...ལེའུ་བཅུ་ཡོད་པ་ལས།  དང་པོ་ལ་གསུམ་ལས། X དང་། Y དང་། Z ...">
    Enumeration Block 2:
    <verbatim Tibetan announcement passage>

Read each block to recover, for every announcement: the parent being divided, the
declared count, and the named parts. The ENUMERATIONS are the author's own skeleton of
the text and are MORE AUTHORITATIVE than individual candidates. Use them two ways:

A. ELIMINATE FALSE POSITIVES — a CANDIDATE section that matches no part named in any
   enumeration, and is not itself the parent of a declared division, is suspect. Drop it
   from the tree unless its ordinal sequence clearly makes it a real sibling. Do not let
   stray numbers or incidental ordinals become nodes.

B. FILL GAPS — but ONLY for STRUCTURAL divisions. Every part of a genuine sa-bcad
   division MUST appear as a child node of its parent; if such a part has no matching
   candidate section, insert it (using the part's title text). The number of children
   under a structural parent must match the count its announcement declared. Do NOT add
   any marker to inserted nodes — they look like every other entry.

   NOT EVERY ENUMERATION IS PART OF THE INLINE TOC. The enumerations file also contains
   DOCTRINAL / CONTENT lists — items enumerated as subject matter being explained, not as
   structural divisions of the text. These must NOT be added to the tree. A list is part
   of the inline TOC (and may seed nodes) ONLY when its parts are subsequently OPENED as
   their own sections — i.e. each part later recurs as an ordinal-led node header
   (དང་པོ་... ནི། / གཉིས་པ་... ལ་... etc.) that the commentary then treats in turn.
   Signs a list is CONTENT, not structure — do NOT make it into nodes:
     - the items are never re-opened later as their own ordinal-led sections
     - it enumerates doctrinal categories, qualities, examples, or stages as the topic
       being discussed (e.g. a list of qualities, perfections, signs) rather than dividing
       the text
     - it sits inside the explanation of a single leaf section without subdividing it
   When in doubt, require corroboration: add a missing node only if the part's absence
   breaks an otherwise-confirmed structural division (some siblings DO appear as real
   headers). Do not expand a content list into a branch of the tree.

MATCHING — names are often WORDED DIFFERENTLY where a part is first declared (in the
enumeration) and where its section actually opens (the node header). Match by MEANING and
shared core content words, NOT by exact string equality. Treat two names as the SAME
section when one is clearly a fuller, shorter, or lightly reworded form of the other:
   - inserted / dropped qualifiers or adverbs (ཅུང་ཟད་ "briefly", མདོ་ཙམ་, རྒྱས་པར་, ...)
   - synonymous verbs or near-synonyms (བསྒྱུར་བ་ ~ བཤད་པ་), added/removed ནི། པ་ པོ་ འོ།
   - abbreviation vs. full phrase, or a different but equivalent ordinal/particle
   Example — these are the SAME section, do NOT treat as a gap or duplicate:
     enumeration part:  ...མཚན་དོན་བཤད་པའོ། །
     node header:       གཉིས་པ་མཚན་དོན་ཅུང་ཟད་བཤད་པ་ལ་གཉིས་ཏེ།
   Use the node header's ORDINAL together with the fuzzy name to align it to the right
   part: a node opening with གཉིས་པ་ is the 2nd declared part of its parent even if its
   wording differs (above, གཉིས་པ་མཚན་དོན་ཅུང་ཟད་བཤད་པ aligns to the parent's 2nd part
   མཚན་དོན་བཤད་པ). When a part and a node match this way, use them as ONE node (prefer the
   node header's wording for the display text) and do NOT create a duplicate sibling.
   Insert a part as a new node only when NO candidate plausibly corresponds to it.
   Likewise, do not split one real section into two because its name varies.

   ALWAYS KEEP THE NODE-TITLE ORDINAL: every node's display text must begin with the
   Tibetan ordinal (དང་པོ་ , གཉིས་པ་ , གསུམ་པ་ ...) exactly as it appears in the node
   header — even when the enumeration's wording of that part has NO ordinal. If the node
   header carries an ordinal, include it; never drop it just because the enumeration
   listed the part without one. But never FABRICATE an ordinal: if NEITHER the node header
   NOR the enumeration part has a Tibetan number, the display text has none (the decimal
   numbering still applies).

Your task: reconstruct the FULL hierarchical table of contents (dkar-chag) as a
single nested tree, reconciled against the enumerations, and emit it with hierarchical
decimal numbering.

HOW TO INFER HIERARCHY (read the Tibetan, do not guess from candidate order alone):

1. Ordinal prefixes mark sibling rank within one parent's enumeration:
   དང་པོ་=1, གཉིས་པ་=2, གསུམ་པ་=3, བཞི་པ་=4, ལྔ་པ་=5, དྲུག་པ་=6, བདུན་པ་=7, ...
   Bracket/parenthetical markers (༡༽, ༢༽, ཀ༽, ཁ༽) follow the same logic.
   A series restarts when a new parent is introduced.

2. An "announcement" candidate that introduces sub-items is a PARENT. Its ITEMS are
   its DIRECT CHILDREN, always one level deeper — never at the same level or above.
   Use the [[N]] line number from each item as the child's [[line]] suffix.
   If an item text itself starts with a Tibetan ordinal (དང་པོ་, གཉིས་པ་, གསུམ་པ་ ...),
   keep it; otherwise emit the item text exactly as written with NO added ordinal.
   Each child that is itself later announced and subdivided becomes a parent in turn —
   match it to the announcement candidate that re-states and divides it.

3. When a peer ordinal reappears (e.g. གཉིས་པ་ after a run of children), return to
   the depth of the matching དང་པོ་ that opened that sibling series.

4. A short candidate that merely names one element of an enumeration (no trailing
   count phrase) is a leaf at its depth.

CLEAN each display string:
   - KEEP the leading Tibetan ordinal prefix (དང་པོ་ , གཉིས་པ་ , གསུམ་པ་ , ...) at the
     START of the display text when the node header or the enumeration part HAS one — it
     must agree with the decimal's last segment and is used for quality-checking, so do NOT
     strip it. But do NOT INVENT an ordinal: if neither the node header nor the enumeration
     part carries a Tibetan ordinal, leave the text without one (the decimal still numbers it).
   - strip leading bullets, bracket markers (༡༽ ཀ༽ ...), and Tibetan decimal labels
   - strip trailing block IDs (^...) and wiki-link wrappers ([[#^id|text]] -> text)
   - strip the [[N]] line-number prefix from ITEMS text (it becomes the [[line]] suffix
     on that node, not part of the display title)
   - NEVER add a Tibetan ordinal to a node whose source text (item or candidate) does
     not already start with one — the decimal number is sufficient
   - KEEP ONLY THE TITLE. Strip everything after the topic name: the division clause that
     announces sub-parts (ལ་གཉིས་ཏེ། / ལ་གསུམ་ལས། / ལ་བཞི། / ...སྟེ། / ...ལས།) and trailing
     grammatical particles / connectives (ནི། / ནི / ལ། / འོ། / པོ། / སྟེ། / དང་). Examples:
       གཉིས་པ་མཚན་དོན་ཅུང་ཟད་བཤད་པ་ལ་གཉིས་ཏེ།  ->  གཉིས་པ་མཚན་དོན་ཅུང་ཟད་བཤད་པ་
       དང་པོ་བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་བསྐྱེད་ཀྱི་རྟེན་ནི།        ->  དང་པོ་བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་བསྐྱེད་ཀྱི་རྟེན་
   - strip any trailing shad (།, །།, ལོ།) — do NOT add a ། at the end of entries
   - keep the full descriptive topic phrase otherwise — do not over-truncate the title

OUTPUT — emit ONLY the TOC block, exactly in this shape and nothing else:

## དཀར་ཆག / Table of Contents

* 1. <clean text> [[<line>]]
   * 1.1 <clean text> [[<line>]]
      * 1.1.1 <clean text> [[<line>]]
   * 1.2 <clean text> [[<line>]]
* 2. <clean text> [[<line>]]

---

FORMAT RULES (follow exactly):
   - indent = 3 spaces × (depth − 1); depth-1 items have no indent
   - decimal = 1. for depth-1, 1.1 for depth-2, 1.1.1 for depth-3, etc.
   - do NOT emit ^toc block IDs — the decimal numbering alone identifies each entry
   - when an entry's text carries a Tibetan ordinal it MUST equal the decimal's last
     segment (གསུམ་པ་ -> ...3 ; གཉིས་པ་ -> ...2); never let them disagree. Do not add a
     Tibetan ordinal that is absent from both the node header and the enumeration.
   - one entry per line, no blank lines between entries
   - counters reset for deeper levels whenever you move up to a shallower level
   - cover the whole document; do not drop branches. Output Tibetan, no English,
     no commentary, no code fences.
   - no trailing particle, no ། , no ⟨gap⟩ or any other marker on any entry.
   - EVERY entry MUST end with [[<line>]] where <line> is:
       • the LINE: number from the matching candidate's SECTION_TITLE, OR
       • the [[N]] prefix from the ITEMS list entry for that child node.
     For nodes inserted from enumerations with no line number, write [[?]].
     Never omit the [[...]] suffix.

# The QC-repair prompt — fixes numbering/structure issues found by the deterministic
# checker, guided by the explicit issue list.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QC_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert in classical Tibetan Buddhist ས་བཅད (sa bcad) TOC trees. You are given a
decimal-numbered TOC tree, a list of QC ISSUES found by an automated checker, the author's
VERBATIM ENUMERATION BLOCKS (the sa-bcad division announcements), and the SECTION
CANDIDATES (the section headers extracted from the text). Produce a CORRECTED tree.

The QC pass FOCUSES ON FOUR THINGS — do these and little else:

1. NUMBERING vs TIBETAN ORDINALS — make the decimal numbering agree with the Tibetan
   ordinal at the start of each node's text (དང་པོ་=1, གཉིས་པ་=2, གསུམ་པ་=3, བཞི་པ་=4,
   ལྔ་པ་=5, དྲུག་པ་=6, བདུན་པ་=7, བརྒྱད་པ་=8, དགུ་པ་=9, བཅུ་པ་=10, ...). The Tibetan
   ordinal is AUTHORITATIVE for a node's position: when the decimal's last segment differs
   from the ordinal, fix the DECIMAL (not the ordinal), then renumber the siblings around it
   and cascade the corrected numbers into all descendants.

2. NO GAPS — every parent's children must run 1, 2, 3 … with NO missing number and NO
   duplicate, and the count must match the number of parts its enumeration declared. If a
   declared child is missing from the tree, FIRST look for it among the SECTION CANDIDATES
   (it may be present under a slightly different wording that was not matched — match by
   meaning, see below) and insert that real node; only if no candidate corresponds, insert
   the enumerated part as a normal node (NO marker). If any entry still carries a "⟨gap⟩"
   marker from a previous run, REMOVE the marker — the final tree must contain no ⟨gap⟩ tags.

3. RECONCILE BOTH SOURCES — fix every issue by checking the tree against BOTH the
   enumerations (what the author declared: parents, counts, ordered parts) AND the section
   candidates (what was actually found in the text). Match names by MEANING and shared core
   words, not exact strings (inserted/dropped qualifiers like ཅུང་ཟད་, near-synonym verbs,
   added/removed ནི། པ་ འོ།). Do not duplicate a node that already exists under a varied name.

4. NO HALLUCINATED NODES — every node's TITLE and its leading Tibetan ORDINAL must
   correspond to a real string in the ENUMERATIONS or SECTION CANDIDATES. The checker flags:
     - "title not attested ... possible hallucination": the node's topic words do NOT occur
       in candidates/enumerations. Either it is a real section recorded under different
       wording (find the matching candidate/enumeration string by meaning and REPLACE the
       node's text with that attested wording), or it is invented — in which case DELETE the
       node and renumber its siblings.
     - "ordinal N not attested for this title": the title exists in the source but with a
       DIFFERENT ordinal (or none). Correct the node's Tibetan ordinal to the one the source
       attaches to that title, then fix the decimal to agree. Never keep an ordinal the
       source did not put on that title.
   Do NOT invent titles or ordinals to satisfy a count; only insert parts that are actually
   present in the enumerations/candidates.

ALSO tidy: indentation must be 3 spaces × (depth − 1); remove duplicate decimals; repair
malformed lines. Strip any trailing division clause (ལ་གཉིས་ཏེ། ...) or particle
(ནི། ལ། འོ། ...) and any trailing ། from the TITLE part only (before the [[line]] suffix).
Do NOT add ^toc block IDs. PRESERVE the trailing [[<line>]] suffix on every entry exactly
as-is; when inserting a gap node, use [[?]] as the suffix.

DO NOT: reorder or reword the topic of existing real nodes; change Tibetan text; turn
doctrinal/content lists into nodes; or INVENT a Tibetan ordinal where neither the node nor
the enumeration has one.

OUTPUT ONLY the corrected tree block, in the exact same shape as the input (starting with
"## དཀར་ཆག / Table of Contents"), no commentary, no code fences.
