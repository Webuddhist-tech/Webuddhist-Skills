# BAC-Term-Localization

This skill fills the six translation columns (En, Zh, Hin, Nep, Rus, Mon) of `$LOCAL_WIKI/BCA-Term-Localization.md`. For each term it reads the Tibetan (Bo column) and the commentary-sourced definition (Meaning column) to determine the precise sense the term carries in this text, then produces a contextually accurate rendering in each target language. Renderings must be clear and accessible — natural in the target language, understandable to a non-specialist — while remaining fully faithful to the commentary's definition. When the Meaning cell contains multiple commentary quotations (two or more sources defining the term), the skill selects the rendering that best fits the Bodhisattvacharyāvatāra's context and register rather than averaging or listing all senses. The skill prevents mislocalization caused by using generic dictionary equivalents for polysemous Tibetan terms: the Meaning column is the authoritative disambiguator. When the Meaning cell is empty for a term, the skill flags the row and skips it rather than guessing from the Tibetan alone.

## Inputs

- **Term or term list** — one or more Tibetan terms from the Bo column of `$LOCAL_WIKI/BCA-Term-Localization.md`. If the user says "all" or supplies no restriction, process every row whose target language cell(s) are empty.
- **Target languages** — one or more of: `En`, `Zh`, `Hin`, `Nep`, `Rus`, `Mon`. Default when not specified: all six.
- **BCA-Term-Localization.md** — `$LOCAL_WIKI/BCA-Term-Localization.md` — the table to update.

---

## Output

`$LOCAL_WIKI/BCA-Term-Localization.md` — modified in place. For each processed term, the relevant translation cells are filled with the rendered term in the target language.

---

## Output cell format

Each translation cell receives a **single rendered term or short phrase** — the localized equivalent of the Tibetan term as defined by the Meaning column. Do not include quotation marks, citations, or explanatory prose in translation cells. The cell must be suitable for use as a glossary entry. Prefer plain, natural phrasing over heavy technical jargon; a rendering that a thoughtful non-specialist can understand without a dictionary is preferred, provided it accurately reflects the commentary's definition.

```
| S.No | Bo    | Meaning | En              | Zh      | Hin        | Nep        | Rus             | Mon            |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | --------------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| N    | [term]| [def]   | [English term]  | [汉字]  | [हिन्दी]   | [नेपाली]   | [Русский]       | [Монгол]       |
```

**Language-specific conventions:**

- **En (English):** Use established Tibetan Buddhist English translation conventions, preferring accessible modern renderings over archaic or heavily Sanskritised ones (e.g., Padmakara, ACIP, Rigpa wiki standards). Where no consensus exists, derive a rendering from the Meaning cell definition and mark it with `*`.
- **Zh (Chinese):** Use standard Chinese Buddhist canon equivalents where they exist (玄奘 translations preferred; Tibetan-Chinese glossary standards). For terms without canon equivalents, use a descriptive Chinese phrase derived from the Meaning cell.
- **Hin (Hindi):** Use Sanskrit-origin Buddhist technical terms in Devanāgarī script where standard Sanskrit equivalents are established. Where no Sanskrit term applies, use a descriptive Hindi phrase.
- **Nep (Nepali):** Use Nepali Buddhist terminology in Devanāgarī script. Nepali terms often parallel Hindi/Sanskrit equivalents; distinguish where Nepali usage differs.
- **Rus (Russian):** Use established Russian Buddhist translation equivalents where attested (e.g., from Е.Е. Обермиллер, Б. Д. Дандарон, or contemporary Russian Dharma translators). Transliterate Sanskrit loanwords in Cyrillic when no native Russian equivalent exists.
- **Mon (Mongolian):** Use classical Mongolian Buddhist terminology where attested in the Mongolian canon (Ganjur/Danjur). For terms without canonical Mongolian equivalents, derive a rendering from the Meaning cell. Write in traditional Mongolian Cyrillic script (Khalkha standard).

## Rules

1. **The Meaning column is the primary source.** Derive the rendering from the commentary definition in the Meaning cell, not from a generic Tibetan–English dictionary or parametric knowledge alone. The Meaning cell resolves polysemy.
2. **Prioritise clarity without sacrificing accuracy.** Each rendering must be easy to understand in the target language — natural phrasing, no unnecessary jargon — but must still faithfully represent the sense given in the Meaning cell. If a simpler word captures the definition as well as a technical one, prefer the simpler word.
3. **When the Meaning cell contains multiple definitions, choose the one most fitting for the BCA.** If the Meaning cell includes quotations from two or more commentaries that give different or complementary senses, do not blend them or list all options. Read the definitions together, judge which sense is most appropriate to the Bodhisattvacharyāvatāra's context (its genre as a Mahāyāna bodhisattva-path text, its audience of practitioners, its ethical and contemplative register), and base the rendering on that sense. Note the choice in the end report.
4. **Skip empty Meaning cells.** If the Meaning cell for a row is blank, do not fill any translation cell for that row. Add the term to the skip list in the end report.
5. **Do not overwrite non-empty cells without explicit instruction.** If a target language cell already contains text, skip it unless the user says to overwrite or append.
6. **Do not modify the Bo or Meaning columns.** Only the six translation columns (En, Zh, Hin, Nep, Rus, Mon) may be changed by this skill.
7. **One rendering per cell.** Each cell holds a single term or short phrase. No definitions, citations, or explanatory brackets in the cell itself. If a term genuinely requires a parenthetical disambiguation, place it in parentheses directly after the rendering: e.g., `mind (aspirational)`.
8. **Flag novel renderings.** When a rendering is derived from the Meaning cell definition rather than from an attested translation convention, append `*` to the cell value: e.g., `vast field*`. Record all flagged renderings in the end report.
9. **Script fidelity.** Write Chinese in Simplified Han unless the user specifies Traditional. Write Hindi and Nepali in Devanāgarī. Write Russian and Mongolian in Cyrillic.
10. **Do not modify `$SOURCES/` files.** This skill reads the table only; it never writes to source files.
11. **Batch safely.** When processing "all" terms, work in sequential row order. Do not skip rows silently — every row is either filled, skipped (empty Meaning), or skipped (cell already populated). All three cases are reported.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Identify terms and target languages

1. Open `$LOCAL_WIKI/BCA-Term-Localization.md` and read the full table.
2. If the user named specific terms, collect only those rows. If the user said "all" or gave no restriction, collect all rows.
3. Determine which target language columns to fill. Default: En, Zh, Hin, Nep, Rus, Mon.
4. For each row, check:
   a. Is the Meaning cell empty? → Add to skip list (reason: no definition).
   b. Is the target language cell already populated? → Add to skip list (reason: already filled), unless the user authorised overwriting.
   c. Otherwise → Add to the work list.

### Step 2 — Translate each term

For each row in the work list, in sequential order:

1. Read the Tibetan term (Bo cell).
2. Read the Meaning cell. Count how many commentary quotations it contains.
   a. **One quotation:** that definition is the meaning to translate.
   b. **Two or more quotations:** read all of them. Identify which sense best fits the BCA — its bodhisattva-path context, practitioner-facing register, and ethical/contemplative subject matter. Select that sense as the basis for translation. Record the chosen commentary and your reasoning briefly in the end report.
3. From the selected meaning, identify the single key sense to translate. Prefer the most direct, natural way to express that sense in each target language; avoid technical terms when a plain equivalent captures the meaning equally well.
4. For each target language column being filled:
   a. Check whether an established canonical or scholarly rendering exists for this Tibetan term carrying this specific meaning.
   b. If an established rendering exists and is clear in the target language: use it (no `*`).
   c. If an established rendering exists but is heavily technical or obscure to non-specialists: assess whether a plainer equivalent is equally faithful. If so, use the plainer form and flag with `*`.
   d. If no established rendering exists: derive one from the selected definition and append `*`.
   e. Apply language-specific script and convention rules (§ Output cell format).
5. Record the proposed rendering for each column.

### Step 3 — Write results to BCA-Term-Localization.md

1. Open `$LOCAL_WIKI/BCA-Term-Localization.md`.
2. For each row in the work list:
   a. Locate the row by S.No and Bo cell value.
   b. Fill each target language cell with the rendering from Step 2.
3. Write the updated file back to disk.
4. Do not reformat, reorder, or change spacing in any other part of the table.

### Step 4 — Report

After processing, report:
- How many rows were processed (translations filled).
- How many rows were skipped due to empty Meaning cells (list the terms).
- How many rows were skipped because target cells were already populated (list the terms).
- How many cells received a flagged rendering (`*`) and in which languages.
