# vault-audit

This skill audits the vault for mechanical integrity issues that accumulate in collaborative work. It is **read-only**: it produces a report and nothing else. All remediation is human-initiated using existing targeted skills.

Run this skill on a weekly schedule or any time after a batch of collaborative changes. Do not run it as part of a transformation workflow — it is a maintenance tool, not a pipeline step.

---

## Inputs

None. The skill operates on the vault as a whole.

## Output

One report file at:

```
$WORK/vault-audit-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
```

Where `<YYYY-MM-DD>` is today's date. If a report already exists for today, append a `-2` suffix rather than overwriting.

## Output file format

```markdown
---
audit_date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
total_issues: <N>
---

# Vault audit — <YYYY-MM-DD>

**<N> issue(s) found.** / **No issues found.**

---

## 1. Skills sync

<✓ No issues found.>
<OR list of issues as checkboxes — see Check 1 below>

## 2. Frontmatter completeness

<✓ No issues found.>
<OR list of issues>

## 3. Citation chain integrity

<✓ No issues found.>
<OR list of issues>

## 4. Status consistency

<✓ No issues found.>
<OR list of issues>

## 5. Stale inbox files

<✓ No files older than 7 days in $WORK/.>
<OR list of files with their modification dates>

## 6. Dead wiki links

<✓ No issues found.>
<OR list of issues>
```

## Rules

1. **Never write to any file other than the report.** This skill is read-only. Do not fix issues, do not update frontmatter, do not modify SKILLS-CATALOG.md or command files.
2. **Report every issue found, even if many.** Do not truncate or summarise away specific file paths — contributors need exact locations to act on.
3. **Use checkboxes for every issue** so contributors can tick items off as they resolve them.
4. **A clean audit is a valid output.** If no issues are found in a category, write `✓ No issues found.` in that section. Do not omit sections.
5. **Do not flag 4-SYSTEM/Skills/ subfolders that lack a SKILL.md** — those may be support-file-only folders (e.g. `converters/`). Only flag folders that contain a `SKILL.md` but are missing a catalog entry or command file.
6. **Do not flag $TRANSFORMATIONS/ About *.md files for missing context_packages:** — those are documentation files, not generated outputs.

## Procedure

### Check 1 — Skills sync

1. List every immediate subdirectory of `4-SYSTEM/Skills/` that contains a `SKILL.md`.
2. For each such directory `<skill-name>`:
   a. Check whether `4-SYSTEM/Skills/SKILLS-CATALOG.md` contains a section heading `### \`<skill-name>\``.
   b. Check whether `.claude/commands/<skill-name>.md` exists.
3. Flag each missing entry as a checkbox item:
   - `- [ ] \`<skill-name>\`: missing from SKILLS-CATALOG.md`
   - `- [ ] \`<skill-name>\`: missing .claude/commands/<skill-name>.md`
4. Also check the reverse: for every entry in SKILLS-CATALOG.md marked `[exists]`, verify a corresponding `4-SYSTEM/Skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` actually exists. Flag any catalog entry pointing to a nonexistent skill folder.

### Check 2 — Frontmatter completeness

Scan every `.md` file in `$RAILS/` and `$TRANSFORMATIONS/` (excluding `About *.md` files).

For files in `$VERSES/`, the minimum required frontmatter fields are:
`verse_id`, `root_text`, `root_block`, `language`, `commentaries`, `status`

For files in `$GLOSSARIES/` (non-Raw), required fields are:
`language_pair`, `source_language`, `target_language`, `raw_sources`, `status`

For files in `$TRANSFORMATIONS/` that are not `About`, `requirements`, `termbase`, `audience`, `schedule`, or `qa-report` files, the required field is:
`context_packages`

Flag each file with a missing required field:
- `- [ ] \`<path>\`: missing frontmatter field(s): <field1>, <field2>`

### Check 3 — Citation chain integrity

Scan all `.md` files in `$TRANSFORMATIONS/` for any occurrence of:
- `[[$SOURCES/` (wiki link into 1-SOURCES)
- `![[$SOURCES/` (transclusion into 1-SOURCES)

Exclude `About *.md` documentation files. Flag each violation:
- `- [ ] \`<path>\`: direct reference to $SOURCES/ bypasses $RAILS/ — line <N>: \`<offending link>\``

### Check 4 — Status consistency

For every file in `$TRANSFORMATIONS/` (excluding About, requirements, termbase, audience, schedule, qa-report) that has `status: complete` in its frontmatter:
1. Read its `context_packages:` list.
2. For each listed rail file, read its frontmatter `status` field.
3. If any rail has `status: draft`, flag the transformation:
   - `- [ ] \`<transformation-path>\`: status: complete but depends on draft rail \`<rail-path>\``

### Check 5 — Stale inbox files

List every file in `$WORK/` with a modification date older than 7 days. For each:
- `- [ ] \`$WORK/<filename>\` — last modified <date>. Review: promote to permanent location or delete.`

Do not flag files in `$WORK/raw-data/` — those are intentionally long-lived staging inputs.

### Check 6 — Dead wiki links

Scan all `.md` files in `$RAILS/` and `$TRANSFORMATIONS/` for internal wiki links matching `[[...]]` and `![[...]]`. For each link:
1. Extract the target file path (strip any `#^block-id` anchor).
2. Resolve the path relative to the vault root.
3. Check whether the target file exists.
4. Flag missing targets:
   - `- [ ] \`<source-path>\`: dead link → \`<target-path>\` (line <N>)`

Skip links to external URLs (`http://`, `https://`). Skip links into `4-SYSTEM/` — documentation cross-links are not production dependencies.

### Check 7 — File placement

This check catches two classes of structural error: files placed in the wrong rail folder, and transformation verse files whose corresponding rail does not yet exist.

**7a — Misplaced files in `$VERSES/`**

Per CLAUDE.md §4, every file in `$VERSES/` must be named with the verse-ID pattern: `<chapter>-<verse>.md` (e.g. `1-1.md`, `6-33.md`). Ignore `.gitkeep`.

For every file in `$VERSES/` whose name does not match `^\d+-\d+\.md`:
- `- [ ] \`$VERSES/<filename>\`: misplaced file — does not follow verse-ID naming convention (\`<chapter>-<verse>.md\`). Review: move to \`$SECTIONS/\` or correct the filename.`

**7b — Missing verse rails for existing transformations**

Collect the set of unique filenames under any `$TRANSFORMATIONS/*/Verses/` directory (e.g. `1-1.md`, `6-33.md`). For each filename that does not have a corresponding file at `$VERSES/<filename>`:
- `- [ ] \`$VERSES/<filename>\`: verse rail missing — transformation(s) exist but no rail has been authored. Do not generate further transformations from this verse until the rail is complete.`

### Write the report

1. Collect all flagged issues across all seven checks.
2. Set `total_issues:` in the frontmatter to the total count of checkbox items.
3. Write the report to `$WORK/vault-audit-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.
4. Do not write or modify any other file.

## Completion check

- [ ] All seven checks have been executed
- [ ] Every flagged issue includes the exact file path and line number where applicable
- [ ] Every section has either a list of checkbox items or `✓ No issues found.`
- [ ] `total_issues:` frontmatter field reflects the correct count
- [ ] No file other than the report was written or modified
